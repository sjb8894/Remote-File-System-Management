# Remote-File-System-Management

Python socket program that allows client to manage a file
system in a remote server called FSM server

The FSM client handles the user commands by interacting with the FSM server that manages
the userâ€™s entire file system. The client program creates the illusion that the user thinks she
manages the file system on her local machine. When the FSM server sends output to the client,
the client displays the output to standard output.
